### Multi-VM Quote Basket (2026-06-14) — COMPLETE

Users can build a multi-VM quote inside the chat UI and export it as Excel or PDF.

**Basket model (numeric, server-side):**
Each line item: `{id, sku, os, region, term, count, vm_unit_cost, disks[], line_total, pricing_text?}`.
`line_total = round((vm_unit_cost + sum(disk.cost)) × count, 4)` — computed server-side on add.
`grand_total = sum(line_total for item in basket)` — always from numeric fields, never text-parsed.

**Backend (`app/routers/basket.py`, `app/state.py`):**
- `POST /api/basket` — add item; returns updated basket list.
- `GET /api/basket` — fetch basket for session.
- `DELETE /api/basket/{item_id}` — remove one line.
- `DELETE /api/basket` — clear basket.
- `GET /api/basket/total` — `{grand_total, item_count}`.
- `POST /api/basket/report/excel` and `/pdf` — structured export (no text-blob parsing).
- Sessions stored in `sessions["{sid}_basket"]` via shared `app/state.py` dict.

**Frontend (`static/index.html`):**
- Header Quote button + live badge (item count).
- Per-card Qty input (default 1) + "Add to Quote" button; captures live dropdown disk state.
- Slide-in Quote Summary drawer: per-line label, VM+storage detail, Remove button, grand total.
- Export Excel / Export PDF buttons in drawer footer (shown when basket non-empty).
- Basket restores on page refresh via `loadBasket()` at init.
- `card._getDiskState()` closure reads live dropdown state at click time — no stale captures.

**Export (`app/agents/report_agent.py`):**
`generate_excel_basket(items, grand_total)` and `generate_pdf_basket(items, grand_total)` — build structured multi-item reports. Per-item: section header `{count}× {sku} | {os} | {region}`, VM cost row, one disk row per disk, line total. GRAND TOTAL at bottom, footnotes. PDF header uses a 2-row Table (both rows `#0078D4`) so title and subtitle are guaranteed stacked with no overlap; subtitle in `#D4E8FF` for readable contrast on blue.

**Alt-region pick fix:**
`_picks` now carries `sku_region_displays[]` (one per option). `fetchPricingForPicks` uses `picks.sku_region_displays[idx]` instead of the global `picks.region_display`, so alt-region fills (e.g. `[Available in Australia East]` options returned for a Melbourne query) are priced in their actual source region — fixes "pricing fetch failed" on those picks.

**Known ASCII-only rule for generated docs:**
Azure/reportlab environment garbles non-ASCII (box-drawing `│` → tofu box; middle-dot `·` → `Â·`). All generated Excel/PDF text must use ASCII separators (`|` or `-`). See section below.

### Advisor deployability gate (2026-06-20) — COMPLETE

Gates advisor recommendations on ARM Compute SKU deployability — prevents recommending or pricing SKUs that exist in the Azure Retail Prices API catalogue but are not actually deployable in the requested region.

**Implementation (`app/services/azure_pricing.py`, `app/agents/sku_advisor_agent.py`):**
- `_get_arm_skus_for_region(region)` — paginated ARM Compute SKUs fetch with 1-hour TTL module-level cache (`_arm_sku_cache`). Shared by `fetch_deployable_skus`, `fetch_temp_storage_gb`, and `vm_supports_premium` — net cost is 1 ARM call per region per hour regardless of how many advisor queries or disk/premium lookups follow.
- `fetch_deployable_skus(region)` — returns `set[str]` of VM SKU names deployable in that region per ARM (`resourceType == 'virtualMachines'`). Returns empty set on failure; callers skip the filter on empty (fail-open, not fail-closed).
- Advisor fires `fetch_deployable_skus` and `fetch_vm_prices_for_region` concurrently via `asyncio.gather` — ARM call overlaps the Prices API pagination, no serialised wait.
- After `_is_standard` filter, advisor filters out any candidate whose `armSkuName` is absent from the deployable set. Logs `excluded=N remaining=M` for observability.

**Root cause fixed:** Azure Retail Prices API publishes "projected" prices for catalogue SKUs with `isPrimaryMeterRegion=false` — these are not deployable in that region, just priced at a projected rate. ARM Compute SKUs is authoritative. Example: `Standard_E4-2as_v6` appeared with a valid `$360.62/mo` price in australiasoutheast but was absent from ARM — the gate now excludes it before scoring.

**Verified (2026-06-20):**
- Melbourne/australiasoutheast, 4 vCPU, 6 GB, Windows → 3 options: D4als_v6, E4as_v6, B4als_v2. All in ARM. No E4-2as_v6. No "?" RAM.
- Australia East, 4 vCPU, 16 GB, Windows → 3 options: D4als_v7, E4-2as_v7, B4pls_v2. All in ARM. No "?" RAM.
- australiasoutheast: 865 deployable SKUs (vs 1185 in australiaeast); ~320 SKUs filtered without over-filtering.

### AI Search index (2026-06-20) — COMPLETE

**Re-indexed:** 1,185 SKUs including Easv6 variants (`Standard_E2as_v6` through `Standard_E96as_v6` and EC variants). Previously missing from index because indexer was only run against australiaeast ARM at initial setup.

**Auth fix (`scripts/index_vm_skus.py`):** Switched from `ClientSecretCredential` (`.env` client secret had expired → `AADSTS90013: Invalid input received from the user`) to `DefaultAzureCredential` — uses `az` CLI credentials locally, Managed Identity in production. No service principal secret needed.

**Important query note:** AI Search full-text search tokenises on underscores — `E4as_v6` tokenises as `E4as` + `v6` and may return 0 hits. Always use a filter query for exact SKU lookups: `$filter=sku_name eq 'Standard_E4as_v6'`. The advisor's search path uses `search.ismatch` / scored text search which is unaffected (token-level match works for recommendation ranking).

**Index staleness:** The index is a point-in-time snapshot of australiaeast ARM SKUs. It drifts as Azure adds/retires SKUs. The ARM deployability gate (`fetch_deployable_skus`) is the correctness gate — a stale index causes "?" in specs but never causes a bad SKU recommendation. Consider scheduling the indexer. [deferred]

### Storage Pricing — Phase 1 §2.2 (2026-06-08) — COMPLETE
Managed disk pricing for VM workloads with interactive selector. Live Azure Retail Prices API, no hardcoded prices.

**Model:** Disks bill by provisioned tier (fixed size → fixed monthly price), NOT per-GB.
Standard HDD (S) / Standard SSD (E) / Premium SSD (P) tier-based via `pick_tier()`; Premium SSD v2 per-GiB linear, capacity-only at free baseline (3000 IOPS / 125 MB/s). Tier→size table static; prices always live-fetched.

**Default OS disk:** Injected in code via shared `resolve_disks()` (used by both `pricing_agent.run()` and `sku_advisor_agent._show_full_pricing()` — unified so paths can't drift). Premium SSD P10 (128 GiB) when premium-capable, else Standard SSD E10.

**Interactive selector (commit 7d6b537):** Card renders type + size dropdowns on each disk row + "Add data disk" button. Backend emits `STORAGE_DATA` JSON (all eligible tier prices for the VM/region, premium-gated). Dropdowns re-price client-side instantly, no server round-trip. Verified: P10→P20 live update on size change.

**Premium gating:** `vm_supports_premium()` reads `PremiumIO` from ARM Compute SKU capabilities. Premium types excluded from `STORAGE_DATA` on non-premium VMs, so dropdown can't offer them; code also downgrades. Applies to defaults and user picks.

**Output:** `=== Storage ===` block in card + Excel + PDF. Footnotes: `*` Standard SSD/HDD capacity-only (transactions excluded); `**` v2 baseline caveat; Premium SSD none.

**Pricing verified correct:** Matched live API to the cent for E4-2as_v7 Windows AU East. Earlier calc discrepancy was a SKU mismatch (as_v7 vs ads_v7), not an error.

**Caching fix (commit c7e1486):** `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` on `/` route — inline JS in `index.html` was being served stale (cost significant debug time; diagnose cache early next time via InPrivate window).

**Deferred to Phase 2:** Standard SSD/HDD transaction costs, full v2 IOPS/throughput, snapshots/backup, blob, Files premium.

### Document generation — ASCII only (2026-06-14)
Azure App Service + reportlab environment garbles non-ASCII characters in generated Excel/PDF files:
- Middle-dot `·` (U+00B7) → `Â·` (UTF-8 bytes misread as Latin-1)
- Box-drawing `│` (U+2502) → tofu box (not in reportlab built-in font's Latin-1 glyph set)
- Em-dash `—` (U+2014) → similar garbling risk

**Rule: use only ASCII in all text written to Excel cells or PDF paragraphs/tables.** Use `|` or ` - ` as separators, not `│`, `·`, or `—`. This applies to `report_agent.py` and any future document-generation code. Recurring issue — bake into every code review of doc generation.

### Known limitations / before-prod (logged 2026-06-14)

**Single-worker dev constraint:**
`startup.sh` runs `-w 1` (single gunicorn worker) so the in-memory basket and session dict are always consistent during development. This is a dev-only workaround.

**⚠ Redis required before basket goes to prod (4 workers):**
All session state (conversation history, advisor picks, quote basket) lives in a plain Python `dict` in `app/state.py` — in-process, per-worker, no persistence. With 4 workers, each request may land on a different process with its own empty dict. The basket silently appears empty on ~75% of prod requests if promoted as-is. This is also the root cause of the "session memory cleared" advisor bug.

**Migration path:** replace `app/state.py` with a Redis-backed adapter (e.g. `aioredis`); key schema stays the same (`{sid}`, `{sid}_advisor_state`, `{sid}_basket`, etc.). Azure Cache for Redis is the standard choice for App Service.

### Known bugs to fix (logged 2026-06-08, not yet addressed)
- Advisor renders literal `**1**`/`**2**`/`**3**` (markdown asterisks not rendering in advisor replies)
- Advisor spec lookup fails for older SKUs (Standard_A6 shows "? GB RAM", wrong vCPU count, no "Best for" line)
- Advisor "session memory cleared" on some option-picks via API/refresh path (root cause: multi-worker — fixed by Redis migration)
- Standard HDD size dropdown can render empty → `$0.00` disk cost shown on card
- Minor formatter spacing nits ("Microsoft RetailRRP", "Capacity only;per-10K")

### Next / deferred
- **Quote history / save** — deferred. Options: (a) new-conversation confirm guard; (b) client-side save/restore to JSON file; (c) named server-side saved quotes (requires Redis + auth). Redis migration gates all server-side persistence options.
- **Session/basket persistence migration** — Redis (Azure Cache for Redis) required before prod basket + saved quotes. Unblocks basket on prod and fixes the multi-worker advisor "session cleared" bug.
- **Phase 2 storage features** — Standard SSD/HDD transaction costs, full v2 IOPS/throughput, snapshots/backup, blob storage, Azure Files premium.
- **AI Search index scheduled re-run** — index is a manual snapshot; drifts as Azure adds SKUs. ARM gate prevents wrong recommendations from stale index (worst case = "?" specs). Schedule weekly/monthly re-index via Azure Function or GitHub Actions cron. [deferred]

### v1.3.0 Changes (2026-06-07)
- **hyperxen.ai live:** Azure managed SSL cert bound (`AA7A318E...`, expires 2026-12-06); `https://hyperxen.ai` returns HTTP 200
- **429 retry fix:** Azure Retail Prices API rate limit handling upgraded to 8 retries with exponential backoff (2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s cap) and 0–1s random jitter to avoid thundering herd
- **Session loss handling:** when a worker restart wipes in-memory session state and user selects an option number (e.g. "3") with no prior context, app returns a clear "session expired, please repeat your requirements" message instead of a generic error
- **Dynamic SKU search:** always returns 3 options for any region by querying Azure Retail Prices API directly — no hardcoded series lists
- **Alt-region label:** `[Available in Australia East]` label only appears on options sourced from the fallback region, not on options from the requested region

### v1.2.1 Fixes (2026-06-06)
- Linux/Windows OS reply after advisor picks now stays in advisor flow instead of routing to `pricing_agent` — re-runs STATE 4 with the new OS, same region and specs
- Azure Retail Prices API Linux filter fixed: `not contains(productName, 'Windows')` is unsupported by the API; now fetches all and filters by OS in Python

### v1.2.0 Changes (2026-06-03)
- **SKU advisor fully dynamic:** queries Azure Retail Prices API directly — no hardcoded series names or SKU lists; works for any region, any VM family, any core count
- **Full region coverage:** returns 3 options even for limited regions like Australia Southeast (was returning only 2 due to Azure AI Search index gaps)
- **Speed:** concurrent metadata lookups via `asyncio.gather()`; response time under 20 seconds (was up to 2 minutes with sequential per-SKU API calls)
- **Alt-region fill:** when fewer than 3 options exist in the requested region, fills remaining slots from Australia East clearly labelled `[Available in Australia East]`
- INFO-level logging enabled globally (`logging.basicConfig(level=INFO)`) — SKU advisor debug output now visible in App Service logs
- Pricing verification now uses `asyncio.gather()` throughout

### v1.1.0 Fixes (2026-05-11)
- Accordion pricing now loads full data when selecting a SKU from advisor results
- Bare numbers (e.g. "1") no longer reset conversation context
- Spec-based queries (e.g. "6 cores 8GB RAM") now route to SKU advisor
- Removed 10,457 stale log/zip files from git tracking
- Added `.gitignore` entries for `app_logs*/`, `*.zip`, `dev_logs*/`, `debug.log`

### Dev SSL — Resolved by Decision (2026-06-07)
Dev stays on self-signed by design. Azure managed cert attempted 2026-06-07 — `az webapp config ssl create` returned exit 0 but the cert never materialised after 20+ min (silent provisioning failure, known intermittent Azure bug; `ssl list` and ARM both showed no cert). Abandoned to avoid the pending-operation lock and 429 throttling this caused previously. Existing self-signed cert (thumbprint `66CB417763C7…`, expires 2027-05-02) remains bound and working. If a real cert is ever needed for dev, use Cloudflare (DNS-only, no proxy) — not Azure managed cert.

## Dev SSL Certificate
- **Type:** Self-signed (Azure managed cert kept failing due to duplicate pending operations)
- **Thumbprint:** `66CB417763C7318ABD21763171CC5ABE2D447C6B`
- **Expires:** 2027-05-02
- **To rotate:** regenerate `dev-hyperxen.pfx` with openssl, upload via `az webapp config ssl upload`, rebind with `az webapp config ssl bind`
- **Password:** stored securely (do not commit to repo)

### Why self-signed instead of Azure managed cert
Azure managed cert (Let's Encrypt via App Service) failed repeatedly due to:
1. Excessive CLI polling created too many pending operations on the subscription
2. Each failed attempt created a 2-hour lock that blocked the next attempt
3. Azure throttled the subscription with 429 Too Many Requests after repeated retries

Solution: Upload a self-signed PFX cert directly — bypasses Azure's provisioning entirely.
For future dev environments, skip managed cert and go straight to self-signed.

## What's Built and Working

- FastAPI chat API (`/api/chat`) with Azure OpenAI GPT-4o
- Multi-turn conversation: collects SKU, region, OS before fetching pricing
- PAYG, 1-Year/3-Year RI, Savings Plan, and Azure Hybrid Benefit pricing
- SKU Normalizer Agent — handles constrained vCPU normalization (e.g. `e42adsv5` → `Standard_E4-2ads_v5`)
- Python SKU normalization always overrides LLM output to prevent hallucinated SKU names
- Temp storage display via Azure ARM API + Managed Identity
- SKU Advisor Agent — scenario-based VM recommendations; queries Azure Retail Prices API directly (no hardcoded series); top 3 picks from general/memory/cost categories; works for any region
- SKU Advisor: full region coverage — `fetch_vm_prices_for_region()` pages through all PAYG VMs in a region; Python filters by vCPU count; no Azure AI Search dependency for candidate discovery
- SKU Advisor: alt-region fill — when fewer than 3 options exist, fills remaining slots from the nearest alternative region (e.g. Australia East) labelled `[Available in Australia East]`
- SKU Advisor: concurrent lookups — `asyncio.gather()` for metadata enrichment and pricing verification; response under 20 seconds
- SKU Advisor: region and OS carry-over from full conversation history — info stated before advisor started is captured without re-asking
- SKU Advisor: typo-tolerant OS detection (`windwos`, `windoes`, `widnows`, `win` all map to Windows; `lin` prefix maps to Linux)
- SKU Advisor: direct option 1/2/3 selection without confirmation loops — "option 2", "2", "what about option 2 pricing", standalone "yes"/"ok" all trigger immediate pricing fetch
- SKU Advisor: follow-up pricing requests after full output (different region, different OS, more cores) handled by pricing_agent with full history context — no fallback to generic response
- Uncertainty routing: "dont know", "don't know", "not sure", "recommend", "which vm" and similar phrases route to SKU Advisor instead of failing in the pricing flow
- SKU Advisor: generation scoring v7=70/v6=60/v5=50/v4=40/v3=30/v2=20 — always recommends newest generation first
- SKU Advisor: vCPUs and RAM now shown in `=== Azure VM Pricing Estimate ===` output
- SKU Advisor: OS detection false positives fixed (words like "handling" no longer trigger Linux match)
- SKU Advisor: OS always asked if not already known, regardless of how advisor was triggered
- Report Agent — Excel (.xlsx) and PDF download from any pricing result; HyperXen.ai branding; download buttons appear inline
- Multi-VM Quote Basket — add any VM+storage combo to a running quote; per-card Qty + "Add to Quote"; slide-in drawer with per-line remove, grand total, Export Excel/PDF buttons; basket restores on refresh
- Basket export — `generate_excel_basket` / `generate_pdf_basket` build from structured numeric model; per-item VM + disk breakdown, line totals, GRAND TOTAL; no text-blob parsing
- Alt-region advisor pick fix — `_picks.sku_region_displays[]` per option; frontend prices each option in its own source region (fixes "pricing fetch failed" on `[Available in Australia East]` alt-region fills)
- Advisor deployability gate — `fetch_deployable_skus()` cross-checks ARM Compute SKUs; candidates absent from ARM filtered before scoring; ARM data cached 1 hour and shared with `fetch_temp_storage_gb` / `vm_supports_premium`; ARM + Prices API fetched concurrently via `asyncio.gather`
- AI Search index refreshed (2026-06-20) — 1,185 SKUs incl. Easv6 variants; indexer switched to `DefaultAzureCredential` (CLI locally, Managed Identity in prod)
- 60+ city-to-region mapping (Australia, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Europe, Americas, Africa)
- Modern SKU preference — v4/v5/v6 ranked above v1/v2; Promo/Basic excluded
- CORS middleware (`allow_origins=["*"]`) for Replit frontend access
- Replit frontend connected to Azure App Service backend (full end-to-end)

## Deployment

### Standard Deploy (Windows)

```bash
cd "C:/Users/Admin/azure-presales-ai-bot"
# Build zip using Python to ensure forward-slash paths (required for Linux extraction)
python3 -c "
import zipfile, os
include = ['app', 'static', 'requirements.txt', 'startup.sh']
exclude_dirs = {'.git', '.venv', '__pycache__', 'antenv'}
with zipfile.ZipFile('deploy.zip', 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zf:
    for item in include:
        if os.path.isfile(item):
            zf.write(item, item)
        else:
            for d, dirs, files in os.walk(item):
                dirs[:] = [x for x in dirs if x not in exclude_dirs]
                for f in files:
                    if f.endswith('.pyc'): continue
                    p = os.path.join(d, f)
                    zf.write(p, p.replace(os.sep, '/'))
"
az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group rg-hyperxen-app-dev --name hyperxen-pricing-bot-db5hmngq3woxa --src deploy.zip
```

> **Critical:** Always use Python's `zipfile` to build the zip on Windows — NOT `Compress-Archive`.
> `Compress-Archive` uses backslash path separators (`app\main.py`). On Linux, those extract as
> literal filenames with backslashes, not directory structure. Python's `zipfile` always uses `/`.

### Check Deploy Logs (if app crashes)

```powershell
# Get publishing creds then fetch docker log via Kudu API
$creds = az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --resource-group rg-hyperxen-app-dev --name hyperxen-pricing-bot-db5hmngq3woxa --query "{user:publishingUserName, pass:publishingPassword}" | ConvertFrom-Json
$encoded = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes("$($creds.user):$($creds.pass)"))
$logList = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://hyperxen-pricing-bot-db5hmngq3woxa.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker" -Headers @{Authorization="Basic $encoded"}
$defaultLog = $logList | Where-Object { $_.machineName -like "*_default" -and $_.machineName -notlike "*scm*" } | Select-Object -First 1
$content = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $defaultLog.href -Headers @{Authorization="Basic $encoded"}
($content -split "`n") | Select-Object -Last 50
```

### Bicep Infrastructure

> Always run `az deployment group what-if --resource-group rg-hyperxen-app-dev --template-file infra/main.bicep` before deploying Bicep to preview changes.

```bash
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-hyperxen-app-dev --template-file infra/main.bicep
```

---

## Post-Bicep Deploy Checklist

After any fresh Bicep deploy, these 3 secrets must be set manually (they are redacted in main.bicep for security):

```powershell
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group rg-hyperxen-app-dev --name hyperxen-pricing-bot-db5hmngq3woxa --settings ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY" AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SECRET" AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY"
```

> These values are not stored in the repo. Keep them in a secure password manager.

## Known API Limitations

### Reserved Instance Availability
The Azure Retail Prices API does not publish RI items for all VM series:

| Case | Condition | Bot behaviour |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | No items returned at all | "VM not found — may be retired or unavailable in this region" |
| 2 | PAYG exists, no RI items | "RI not available via public API — verify at azure.com/calculator" |
| 3 | RI items exist | Shows correct RI pricing |

Affected series for Case 2: HPC series (HC44rs, HB-series, HBv2, HBv3), some specialty SKUs.

### Windows RI License Pricing
Azure does not publish Windows-specific RI items for older VM series (DSv2, Dv2, FSv2). Windows licence shown at PAYG RRP rate. Newer series (v4, v5+) publish Windows RI items correctly.

### Savings Plan Data
`savingsPlan` field is only present on Linux Consumption items. Always fetch Linux item to get Savings Plan rates; Windows items never carry this field.

### VM Retirement
Retirement notices: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/retirement-announcements
When API returns no items for a SKU it may be retired — bot surfaces "VM not found" message.
